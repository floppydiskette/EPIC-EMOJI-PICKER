# EPIC EMOJI PICKER
## emoji picker program i made cause i was tired of tweetdeck not having one

![](images/emoji-picker.gif)   
### have you ever wanted to use one of the 9 emojis i commonly use?
if so, this is the program for you!

## compiling it
idk it's cmake so it's just the normal cmake routine  
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
etc...  
  
i don't remember what dependencies it needs, but it uses fltk so just look them up ðŸ™‚

## usage
run the program and it'll show you a window of 9 emojis  
click on one of them and it'll be copied to your clipboard  
  
don't close the program because that'll remove the emoji from your clipboard  
wait until you're finished pasting them and then close it (either use the X or hit escape)  
  
if you're wondering why i haven't made this better, i'm lazy and it's 4am right now as i'm writing this.

## license
idk just credit me
